# DatoCMS Plugin Schedule Listings

This plugin exists because we needed a way to model our broadcasts across various time slots. Example:

- Monday – Friday 3pm EST
- Saturday 4am CST
- Sunday 10am PST

## Using this plugin

After installing this plugin, simply create a JSON field, and change the **Field editor** value to **Schedule Listings**.

You may want to create a block from that field, and then use it in a Modular Content field.
